# Full-Stack Tree Editing App with Next.js (Frontend) and NestJS (Backend)

This project implements a full-stack application that allows users to edit a tree data structure and store the data in a database. The frontend is built with Next.js and utilizes a user context for managing user state. The backend is built with NestJS and interacts with a database to store and retrieve the tree data.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **State Management:** React Context (optional)
- **Backend:** NestJS
- **Database:** (Replace with your chosen database)

## Features

- User Login/Authentication (placeholder, implement your preferred method)
- Tree Display with Node Editing
- Database Integration for Persistent Data Storage
- Username Context for Frontend State Management (optional)

## Project Structure

- `frontend/` - Next.js application for the frontend user interface
- `backend/` - NestJS application for the backend API

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
cd frontend && npm install
cd backend && npm install
```

3. Configure your chosen database connection details in the backend project (modify .env or other configuration files).
4. Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend && npm run start:dev
```

5.Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

6. Access the application in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).

## Further Development Ideas

- Implement user login/authentication for secure data access.
- Enhance the tree editing experience with features like drag-and-drop or node deletion.
- Integrate user-specific data based on the username context.
- Implement unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.
